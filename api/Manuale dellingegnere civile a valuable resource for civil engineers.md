# Manuale dell'ingegnere civile: a valuable resource for civil engineers
 
The Manuale dell'ingegnere civile (Manual of civil and industrial engineering) is a classic reference work for civil engineers, first published in 1878 by Giuseppe Colombo, a prominent Italian engineer and professor. The manual covers a wide range of topics related to civil engineering, such as mathematics, mechanics, hydraulics, construction, materials, geology, transportation, and more. It also includes numerous tables, figures, formulas, and examples to illustrate the concepts and applications.

The manual has been revised and updated several times over the years, with the latest edition published in 2012 by Hoepli[^6^]. The new edition consists of three volumes, with 7104 pages, 4094 figures, and 1948 tables. It reflects the latest developments and innovations in the field of civil engineering, as well as the current regulations and standards. The manual is written in Italian, but some sections have been translated into English and other languages.
 
The Manuale dell'ingegnere civile is a valuable resource for civil engineers who want to deepen their knowledge and skills in their profession. It is also a useful tool for students and researchers who want to learn more about the history and principles of civil engineering. The manual can be purchased online or in bookstores, or downloaded for free from the Internet Archive[^1^] [^5^]. However, downloading the manual from torrent sites may be illegal or unsafe, so it is advisable to use official sources.

In this article, we will explore some of the main topics and features of the Manuale dell'ingegnere civile, and provide some examples of how it can be used in practice. We will also compare it with other similar reference works for civil engineers, and highlight its strengths and limitations.
 
## Topics and features of the Manuale dell'ingegnere civile
 
The Manuale dell'ingegnere civile covers a wide range of topics related to civil engineering, divided into 18 sections. Each section consists of several chapters, which are further subdivided into paragraphs and sub-paragraphs. The sections are:
 
1. Mathematics: this section covers the basic mathematical tools and methods used in civil engineering, such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, and optimization.
2. Mechanics: this section covers the fundamental principles and laws of mechanics, such as kinematics, dynamics, statics, work and energy, momentum and impulse, elasticity, plasticity, fracture mechanics, vibrations, and fluid mechanics.
3. Hydraulics: this section covers the theory and applications of hydraulics, such as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, pipe flow, open channel flow, hydraulic machines, hydraulic structures, groundwater flow, hydrology, and hydraulic engineering.
4. Construction: this section covers the general aspects of construction engineering, such as project management, construction methods and equipment, safety and quality control, surveying and geodesy, soil mechanics and foundations, structural analysis and design, reinforced concrete structures, steel structures, timber structures, masonry structures, composite structures, prestressed concrete structures, bridges and viaducts.
5. Materials: this section covers the properties and behavior of various materials used in civil engineering,
